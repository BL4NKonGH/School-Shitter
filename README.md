# School-Shitter

Are you looking to annoy your IT-teacher or simply troll your friends? Look no further, as this tool is perfect for you!

## Functions

### 1. CMD-Spam

**WARNING: This tool can crash a PC in just 1 or 2 seconds! The only way to turn off the PC is by removing the power cable.** The program loops opening cmd windows, which are then looping opening more cmd windows, and so on. Once you run this command, the only way to stop it is by force closing the PC.

### 2. Background on Start Up

On some school PCs, you cannot change the background or the background resets after every restart. This tool changes that. Simply find a picture on the web, paste the picture URL in the text box, and click "Confirm". Your background will always stay the same after you restart the PC.

### 3. Start Up Link

This function allows the PC to always open the link you typed in the text box after it starts.
